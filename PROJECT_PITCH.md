# VibeCare - 2 Minute Project Pitch

## The Problem

College students face unprecedented mental health challenges. According to recent studies, over 60% of college students experience overwhelming anxiety, and many don't seek help due to stigma, cost, or accessibility barriers. Traditional mental health resources are often overwhelmed, leaving students without timely support when they need it most.

## Our Solution: VibeCare

VibeCare is a comprehensive mental wellness platform designed specifically for college students. Think of it as your personal wellness companion that combines AI-powered support, mood tracking, and peer community—all in one accessible web application.

## Key Features

**AI Companions**: Students can chat with a personalized AI companion—choose from a friendly cat, dog, or panda. These companions use advanced AI to provide empathetic support and evidence-based cognitive behavioral therapy techniques. For deeper support, there's a professional CBT therapist mode that uses therapeutic frameworks to help students work through challenges.

**Wellness Tracking**: Students log their daily moods and track emotional patterns over time through beautiful, intuitive charts. The system helps identify triggers and patterns, providing insights into their mental wellness journey.

**Safe Community Space**: The Common Room offers a moderated space where students can share experiences and support each other. It uses AI to monitor conversations and automatically detects concerning content, recommending professional help when needed.

**Gamification**: To encourage engagement, students earn coins through daily check-ins and maintaining wellness streaks. They can customize their pixel avatar with fun accessories, making mental health care feel less clinical and more engaging.

## The Technology

Built on modern web technologies with React and TypeScript, VibeCare uses Supabase for secure data management and Google's Gemini AI for intelligent conversations. Everything is encrypted, privacy-focused, and follows strict security protocols—critical for handling sensitive mental health data.

## Impact & Future

VibeCare addresses the accessibility gap in student mental health support. It's available 24/7, stigma-free, and costs a fraction of traditional therapy. While it's not a replacement for professional care, it serves as a crucial first line of support and a bridge to professional services when needed.

The platform can scale to serve millions of students, and we're building partnerships with university counseling centers to integrate VibeCare as a complementary resource to their existing services.

## Why It Matters

Mental health shouldn't be a luxury. VibeCare democratizes access to mental wellness support, meeting students where they are—on their phones, on their schedule, in a format that feels natural and engaging. We're not just building an app; we're building a supportive community that normalizes mental health conversations and makes getting help as easy as sending a text.

Every student deserves to feel supported, understood, and equipped to handle life's challenges. That's what VibeCare delivers.
